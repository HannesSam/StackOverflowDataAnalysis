    "To acquire a large number of Stack Overflow questions regarding C# you can query the official Stack Overflow database with SQL queries at https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries. These queries can only return 50 000 results at a time so multiple queries have to be made to get all the questions from within a specific period of time. The time frame chosen in this report was 2019-09-22 to 2020-11-08. This period of time was chosen since this is the period of time that C# 8 was the current release of C# and the assumption here was that the documentation regarding new features could be the most lacking.\n",

    "The query used is as follows: <br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE Tags LIKE '%c#%' AND posts.CreationDate < 'Insert start data here' AND posts.CreationDate > 'Insert end date here'\n",
    "ORDER BY posts.CreationDate desc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this operation has to be done in multiple queries the date input will vary but in the end, you will end up with a number of .CSV files containing the data. In our case, we ended up with three files containing 117 527 questions. These files were then combined into one which is the Data.csv file that you can see in the following steps."
